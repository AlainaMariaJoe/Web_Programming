        <h2>"What is Machine Learning?"</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.<br> ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn.<br> Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.</p>

    <h2>"Features of Machine learning?"</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is data driven technology. Large amount of data generated by organizations on daily bases. So, by notable relationships in data, organizations makes better decisions.<br>
        Machine can learn itself from past data and automatically improve.<br>
        From the given dataset it detects various patterns on data.<br>
        For the big organizations branding is important and  will become more easy to target relatable customer base.<br>
        It is similar to data mining because it is also deals with the huge amount of data.</p>

    <h2>"What are the different type of machine learning algorithms ?"</h2>
    <p>Supervised algorithms:<br> These are the algorithms which learn from the labelled data, e.g. images labelled with dog face or not. Algorithm depends on supervised or labelled data. e.g. regression, object detection, segmentation.<br>
        Non-Supervised algorithms: <br>These are the algorithms which learn from the non labelled data, e.g. bunch of images given to make a similar set of images. e.g. clustering, dimensionality reduction etc.<br>
        Semi-Supervised algorithms:<br> Algorithms that uses both supervised or non-supervised data. Majority portion of data use for these algorithms are not supervised data. e.g. anamoly detection.</p>

    <h2>"Why we use machine learning?"</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is used to make decisions based on data. By modelling the algorithms on the bases of historical data, Algorithms find the patterns and relationships that are difficult for humans to detect.<br>These patterns are now further use for the future references to predict solution of unseen problems.</p>
